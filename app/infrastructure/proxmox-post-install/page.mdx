# Proxmox Post-Install Script

Automate essential Proxmox VE post-installation tasks with a single community-maintained script. This eliminates manual configuration and gets your system production-ready in minutes.

> **Version Reference**: This guide is updated for **Proxmox VE 9.0-1** (Debian 13 "Trixie") released August 5, 2025. The script also supports Proxmox VE 8.x, automatically detecting your version and using the appropriate repository format (deb822 for PVE 9, legacy format for PVE 8).

## What is the Post-Install Script?

The [Proxmox VE Post Install Script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=post-pve-install) is a community-maintained tool that automates common post-installation tasks. Created by @tteck and now maintained by the community, it handles repository configuration, system updates, and quality-of-life improvements automatically.

> **New in PVE 9**: The script was updated to support Debian 13 "Trixie" with the modern deb822 repository format, ensuring proper package source configuration for fresh PVE 9.0 installations.

## What It Does

The script performs several essential configurations:

### Repository Management
- **Corrects Proxmox VE sources** - Configures correct Debian package repositories using modern deb822 format (PVE 9) or legacy format (PVE 8)
- **Enables non-free-firmware component** - Required for microcode updates (enabled by default in PVE 9)
- **Disables Enterprise Repository** - Removes or disables the subscription-only repo
- **Enables No-Subscription Repository** - Adds the free community repo
- **Configures Ceph repositories** - Adds disabled Ceph repos for future use
- **Adds Test Repository** - Adds the pvetest repo (disabled by default)

### System Improvements
- **Disables Subscription Nag** - Removes the "No valid subscription" popup in both web and mobile UI
- **Optimizes for Single-Node** (optional) - Disables High Availability and Corosync services to save resources
- **Updates System Packages** - Runs full system update and upgrade
- **Offers Reboot** - Prompts to reboot to apply all changes

## When to Use This Script

### Perfect For
- **Fresh Proxmox installations** - Run immediately after installing Proxmox
- **Homelab setups** - Non-production environments without enterprise subscriptions
- **Quick deployment** - When you want to get up and running fast
- **Learning environments** - Students and hobbyists exploring Proxmox

### Consider Manual Configuration
- **Enterprise environment** - You have a Proxmox subscription
- **Production systems** - You need full control over every change
- **Custom repository needs** - You use specific package sources
- **Learning purposes** - You want to understand each step

## Quick Start

### Running the Script

1. After Proxmox installation, log into the web interface at `https://YOUR-IP:8006`
2. Click on your node name in the left sidebar
3. Click **Shell** to open the terminal

![open shell](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/open-shell.png)

4. Grab the install command from the [PVE Post Install](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=post-pve-install) page.

![copy-install-script](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/copy-install-script.png)

Then paste it in the shell

![run-script](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/run-script.png)

### Interactive Prompts

The script will ask you several questions. The exact questions depend on your current configuration:

Start by typing `y` and hitting enter to start the Proxmox VE Post Install Script

![start-script](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/start-script.png)

You may see a notice about using Modern deb822 sources

![modern-sources](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/modern-sources.png)

#### Repository Configuration

1. **'pve-enterprise' repository already exists. What do you want to do?**
   - disable for homelab, enterprise repo requires a subscription

![disable-pve-enterprise](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/disable-pve-enterprise.png)

2. **'ceph enterprise'repository already exists. What do you want to do?**
   - disable unless you intend to use ceph (most do not)

![disable-ceph](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/disable-ceph.png)

3. **Add 'pve-no-subscription' repository (deb822)?**
   - Choose OK. Provides access to all open-source Proxmox components

![add-pve-no-sub](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/add-pve-no-sub.png)

4. **Add (Disabled) 'pvetest' repository (deb822)?** - Choose `yes`
   - Adds the testing repository (disabled by default)
   - You can enable it later if you want bleeding-edge features

![add-test](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/add-test.png)

#### System Configuration

5. **Disable subscription nag?**
   - Choose `yes` then `OK`. Removes the "No valid subscription" popup from the web interface

![disable-nag](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/disable-nag.png)

Then click `OK` to proceed.

![support-subs](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/support-subs.png)

6. **Disable High Availability**:
   - Choose `yes` then `OK` if you will not be using high availability (most people)

![high-avail](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/high-avail.png)

7. **Disable Corosync?**
   - Choose `yes` and then `OK` if not using high availability.
   - Corosync is the cluster communication layer
   - Only needed for multi-node Proxmox clusters
   - Safe to disable on standalone servers

![corosync](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/corosync.png)

8. **Update Proxmox VE?** - 
   - Choose `yes` then `OK`.
   - Runs `apt update` and `apt dist-upgrade` to update all packages

![update](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/update.png)

This may take some time as it downloads and applies the latest updates.

![updating](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/updating.png)

Read and accept the notice:

![post-install-reminder](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/post-install-reminder.png)

9. **Reboot Proxmox VE?** 
   - Choose `yes` then `OK`
   - Recommended to apply all updates

![reboot](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install/reboot.png)

You can now close the shell and wait a few minutes before refreshing the Web UI with "CTRL+SHIFT+R". 

> **Pro Tip**: For most homelab users with a single-node setup, answer `yes` to all questions. This will configure your system with the community repositories and optimize it for standalone use.
