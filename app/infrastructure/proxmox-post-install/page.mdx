# Proxmox Post-Install Script

Automate essential Proxmox VE post-installation tasks with a single community-maintained script. This eliminates manual configuration and gets your system production-ready in minutes.

> **Version Reference**: This guide covers **Proxmox VE 8.x** (Debian 12 "Bookworm") and **Proxmox VE 9.0** (Debian 13 "Trixie"). The script automatically detects your version and uses the appropriate configuration method.

## What is the Post-Install Script?

The [Proxmox VE Post Install Script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=post-pve-install) is a community-maintained tool that automates common post-installation tasks. Created by @tteck and now maintained by the community, it handles repository configuration, system updates, and quality-of-life improvements automatically.

## What It Does

The script performs several essential configurations:

### Repository Management
- **Corrects Proxmox VE sources** - Configures correct Debian package repositories
- **Disables Enterprise Repository** - Removes or disables the subscription-only repo
- **Enables No-Subscription Repository** - Adds the free community repo
- **Configures Ceph repositories** - Adds disabled Ceph repos for future use
- **Adds Test Repository** - Adds the pvetest repo (disabled by default)

### System Improvements
- **Disables Subscription Nag** - Removes the "No valid subscription" popup in both web and mobile UI
- **Optimizes for Single-Node** (optional) - Disables High Availability and Corosync services to save resources
- **Updates System Packages** - Runs full system update and upgrade
- **Offers Reboot** - Prompts to reboot to apply all changes

## Quick Start

### Running the Script

1. After Proxmox installation, log into the web interface at `https://YOUR-IP:8006`
2. Click on your node name in the left sidebar
3. Click **Shell** to open the terminal
4. Run the following command:

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/tools/pve/post-pve-install.sh)"
```

### Interactive Prompts

The script will ask you several questions. The exact questions depend on your current configuration:

#### Repository Configuration

1. **Correct Proxmox VE sources?** - Choose `yes`
   - Updates package sources to the correct Debian repositories

2. **Disable 'pve-enterprise' repository?** - Choose `yes` for homelab
   - The enterprise repository requires a Proxmox subscription

3. **Enable 'pve-no-subscription' repository?** - Choose `yes`
   - Provides access to all open-source Proxmox components

4. **Correct 'ceph package sources'?** - Choose `yes`
   - Adds (disabled) Ceph repositories for future use

5. **Add (Disabled) 'pvetest' repository?** - Choose `yes`
   - Adds the testing repository (disabled by default)
   - You can enable it later if you want bleeding-edge features

#### System Configuration

6. **Disable subscription nag?** - Choose `yes`
   - Removes the "No valid subscription" popup from the web interface

7. **Disable High Availability** (conditional):
   - If HA **is running**: "Disable high availability?" - Choose `yes` for single-node setups

8. **Disable Corosync?** (only if disabling HA) - Choose `yes` for single-node
   - Corosync is the cluster communication layer
   - Only needed for multi-node Proxmox clusters
   - Safe to disable on standalone servers

9. **Update Proxmox VE?** - Choose `yes` (recommended)
   - Runs `apt update` and `apt dist-upgrade` to update all packages

10. **Reboot Proxmox VE?** - Choose `yes`
    - Recommended to apply all updates

> **Pro Tip**: For most homelab users with a single-node setup, answer `yes` to all questions. This will configure your system with the community repositories and optimize it for standalone use.

## Advanced Options

### Running Non-Interactively

If you want to automate the script with pre-set answers:

```sh
# Example: Accept all defaults automatically (not recommended for first-time users)
yes | bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/tools/pve/post-pve-install.sh)"
```

## When to Use This Script

### ✅ Perfect For:
- **Fresh Proxmox installations** - Run immediately after installing Proxmox
- **Homelab setups** - Non-production environments without enterprise subscriptions
- **Quick deployment** - When you want to get up and running fast
- **Learning environments** - Students and hobbyists exploring Proxmox

### ⚠️ Consider Manual Configuration If:
- **Enterprise environment** - You have a Proxmox subscription
- **Production systems** - You need full control over every change
- **Custom repository needs** - You use specific package sources
- **Learning purposes** - You want to understand each step

## Community Scripts Collection

The post-install script is just one of [400+ scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/) available from the community. Other useful scripts include:

- **LXC container installers** - One-command deployments for Docker, Portainer, Home Assistant, and more
- **VM creation scripts** - Automated VM setups
- **Maintenance utilities** - Backup, cleanup, and monitoring tools
- **Network configuration** - VLAN, bridge, and bond setup helpers

> **Pro Tip**: Bookmark [community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/) - you'll reference it often when deploying services!

## Security & Trust

These scripts are:
- **Open source** - All code is visible on GitHub
- **Community reviewed** - Multiple contributors review changes
- **MIT licensed** - Free to use and modify
- **Actively maintained** - Regular updates and improvements

**Always review scripts before running**, especially when running as root. The scripts are trusted by thousands of Proxmox users, but it's good practice to understand what runs on your system.

## Next Steps

After running the post-install script:

1. **[Get Started with Proxmox](/infrastructure/proxmox-getting-started)** - Learn how to create VMs, containers, manage storage, and perform essential tasks
2. **Create your first VM** - Upload an ISO and create a virtual machine
3. **Create your first LXC container** - Deploy a lightweight Linux container
4. **Configure additional storage** (optional) - Add extra drives, NFS shares, or network storage as needed
5. **Set up backups** - Use Proxmox Backup Server (recommended) or configure built-in backups to NFS/local storage
