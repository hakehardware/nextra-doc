# Installing Proxmox VE

A straightforward guide to installing Proxmox Virtual Environment on bare metal hardware. This guide covers the essentials to get you up and running quickly.

> **Version Reference**: This guide is written for **Proxmox VE 8.3/8.4** (based on Debian 12 "Bookworm"). The installation process is similar across versions, but UI elements and default options may vary in future releases.

## What You'll Need

- **Hardware**: 64-bit x86 CPU with virtualization support (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
- **RAM**: Minimum 2GB (4GB+ recommended for running VMs)
- **Storage**: At least 32GB (SSD strongly recommended)
- **Network**: One network interface (multiple recommended for advanced setups)
- **USB Drive**: 4GB+ for installation media

> **Pro Tip**: Check that virtualization is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI before starting. Look for settings like "Intel VT-x", "AMD-V", or "Virtualization Technology".

## Step 1: Download Proxmox VE

1. Visit the [Proxmox Download Page](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/proxmox-virtual-environment/iso)
2. Download the latest Proxmox VE ISO Installer
3. Verify the checksum (optional but recommended)

## Step 2: Create Installation Media

### On Windows
Use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/):
- Select your USB drive
- Choose the Proxmox ISO
- **Important**: Use DD mode (not ISO mode)
- Click Start

### On Linux
```sh
# Replace /dev/sdX with your USB device (check with lsblk)
sudo dd if=proxmox-ve_*.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
```

### On macOS
```sh
# Find your USB device
diskutil list
```

```sh
# Unmount the USB drive (replace N with disk number)
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN
```

```sh
# Write the ISO (replace N with disk number)
sudo dd if=proxmox-ve_*.iso of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m
```

> **Pro Tip**: Double-check your device path with `lsblk` or `diskutil list` - writing to the wrong device will destroy your data!

## Step 3: Boot from Installation Media

1. Insert the USB drive into your target machine
2. Boot into BIOS/UEFI (usually F2, F10, F12, or DEL during startup)
3. Set USB as the first boot device or use boot menu
4. Save and restart

## Step 4: Install Proxmox VE

### Choose Installation Type

When the installer boots, you'll see several options. Select:
- **Install Proxmox VE (Graphical)** - Recommended for most users

Once loaded, accept the EULA to continue.

### Select Target Disk
If you're new to Proxmox, start with **ext4**. You can always add additional storage with ZFS later.

> **Warning**: All data on the selected disk will be **permanently erased**!

### Configure Location & Time

1. Select your **Country**
2. Choose your **Time zone**
3. Select your **Keyboard Layout**

![time](/photos/infrastructure/proxmox-installation/time.png)

### Set Administrator Password

1. Enter a strong password for the **root** account
2. Provide an **email address** for system notifications

> **Pro Tip**: This email receives important system alerts. Use a real address you check regularly, or set up email forwarding later.

### Network Configuration

For many people this is the hardest to know what to select.

1. **Management Interface**: Select your primary network interface. Typically it is autoselected, and there should be a green dot if active which is a good sign everything is working.
2. **Hostname**: This does not matter too much. Give your server a meaningful name (e.g., `pve1.internal`)
3. **IP Address**: Choose between:
   - **DHCP**: Automatic (easier but IP may change)
   - **Static**: Manual (recommended, but must not already be in use, and it is a good idea to reserve this on your router as well)
4. **Gateway**: Your router's IP address (usually `192.168.1.1`)
5. **DNS Server**: Use your router's IP or public DNS (e.g., `8.8.8.8`)

> **Pro Tip**: Use a **static IP** for your Proxmox host. Document this IP - you'll need it to access the web interface!

### Review & Install

1. Review all settings
2. Click **Install**
3. Wait for installation (usually 5-10 minutes)
4. Remove USB drive when prompted
5. Reboot

When the host boots up you should see the boot menu. It should have the correct option selected and will proceed automatically

Once the system boots up you will see a login screen with the IP listed.

You do not need to log in via the terminal.

## Step 5: Access Proxmox Web Interface

1. On another computer on the same network, open a web browser
2. Navigate to: `https://YOUR-PROXMOX-IP:8006`
   - Example: `https://192.168.1.100:8006`
3. Accept the self-signed certificate warning (this is normal)
4. Login with:
   - **Username**: `root`
   - **Realm**: `Linux PAM standard authentication`
   - **Password**: The password you set during installation

> **Pro Tip**: Bookmark this URL! You'll access it frequently.

## Post-Installation: Essential Tasks

Check out the [Post-Install Script](/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install) that handles repository configuration, updates, and subscription nag removal automatically with a single command!

## Next Steps

Now that Proxmox is installed, here's what to do next:

1. **[Run the Post-Install Script](/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install)** - Automate repository configuration, updates, and subscription nag removal with a single command
2. **[Getting Started with Proxmox](/infrastructure/proxmox-getting-started)** - Learn how to create VMs, containers, manage storage, and perform essential tasks

Additional tasks you can explore:
- **Configure storage**: Add additional drives or network storage
- **Set up backups**: Configure automated backup schedules
- **Explore clustering**: Connect multiple Proxmox hosts (advanced)

## Official Documentation

This guide covers the basics to get you started quickly. For advanced topics, consult the official documentation:

- **[Proxmox VE Installation Guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/chapter-pve-installation.html)** - Comprehensive installation documentation
- **[Proxmox VE Administration Guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html)** - Complete system administration reference
- **[Proxmox VE Wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page)** - Community-maintained documentation and tutorials

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Web Interface
- Verify the IP address with `ip addr show` in the server console
- Check firewall rules: `iptables -L`
- Ensure port 8006 isn't blocked by your network firewall

### Virtualization Not Working
- Verify virtualization is enabled in BIOS: `egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo` (should return > 0)
- Reboot and enable VT-x/AMD-V in BIOS settings

### Installation Fails
- Verify ISO checksum - corrupt download is a common issue
- Try different USB creation tools (Rufus DD mode vs Etcher)
- Check hardware compatibility on the Proxmox forums
