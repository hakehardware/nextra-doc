# Installing Proxmox VE

A straightforward guide to installing Proxmox Virtual Environment on bare metal hardware. This guide covers the essentials to get you up and running quickly.

> **Version Reference**: This guide is written for **Proxmox VE 8.3/8.4** (based on Debian 12 "Bookworm"). The installation process is similar across versions, but UI elements and default options may vary in future releases.

## What You'll Need

- **Hardware**: 64-bit x86 CPU with virtualization support (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
- **RAM**: Minimum 2GB (4GB+ recommended for running VMs)
- **Storage**: At least 32GB (SSD strongly recommended)
- **Network**: One network interface (multiple recommended for advanced setups)
- **USB Drive**: 4GB+ for installation media

> **Pro Tip**: Check that virtualization is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI before starting. Look for settings like "Intel VT-x", "AMD-V", or "Virtualization Technology".

## Step 1: Download Proxmox VE

1. Visit the [Proxmox Download Page](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/proxmox-virtual-environment/iso)
2. Download the latest Proxmox VE ISO Installer
3. Verify the checksum (optional but recommended)

## Step 2: Create Installation Media

### On Windows
Use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/):
- Select your USB drive
- Choose the Proxmox ISO
- **Important**: Use DD mode (not ISO mode)
- Click Start

### On Linux
```bash
# Replace /dev/sdX with your USB device (check with lsblk)
sudo dd if=proxmox-ve_*.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
```

### On macOS
```bash
# Find your USB device
diskutil list
```

```bash
# Unmount the USB drive (replace N with disk number)
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN
```

```bash
# Write the ISO (replace N with disk number)
sudo dd if=proxmox-ve_*.iso of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m
```

> **Pro Tip**: Double-check your device path with `lsblk` or `diskutil list` - writing to the wrong device will destroy your data!

## Step 3: Boot from Installation Media

1. Insert the USB drive into your target machine
2. Boot into BIOS/UEFI (usually F2, F10, F12, or DEL during startup)
3. Set USB as the first boot device or use boot menu
4. Save and restart

## Step 4: Install Proxmox VE

### Choose Installation Type

When the installer boots, you'll see several options. Select:
- **Install Proxmox VE (Graphical)** - Recommended for most users

{/* Add screenshot: Installation menu */}

### Select Target Disk

1. Click "Options" to choose filesystem:
   - **ext4**: Simple, reliable, good for single disk setups
   - **ZFS**: Advanced features (snapshots, RAID), requires more RAM
   - **LVM**: Flexible storage management

2. Select your target hard drive

> **Pro Tip**: If you're new to Proxmox, start with **ext4**. You can always add additional storage with ZFS later.

> **Warning**: All data on the selected disk will be **permanently erased**!

### Configure Location & Time

1. Select your **Country**
2. Choose your **Time zone**
3. Select your **Keyboard Layout**

### Set Administrator Password

1. Enter a strong password for the **root** account
2. Provide an **email address** for system notifications

> **Pro Tip**: This email receives important system alerts. Use a real address you check regularly, or set up email forwarding later.

### Network Configuration

1. **Management Interface**: Select your primary network interface
2. **Hostname**: Give your server a meaningful name (e.g., `pve1.local`)
3. **IP Address**: Choose between:
   - **DHCP**: Automatic (easier but IP may change)
   - **Static**: Manual (recommended for servers)
4. **Gateway**: Your router's IP address (usually `192.168.1.1`)
5. **DNS Server**: Use your router's IP or public DNS (e.g., `8.8.8.8`)

> **Pro Tip**: Use a **static IP** for your Proxmox host. Document this IP - you'll need it to access the web interface!

{/* Add screenshot: Network configuration */}

### Review & Install

1. Review all settings
2. Click **Install**
3. Wait for installation (usually 5-10 minutes)
4. Remove USB drive when prompted
5. Reboot

## Step 5: Access Proxmox Web Interface

1. On another computer on the same network, open a web browser
2. Navigate to: `https://YOUR-PROXMOX-IP:8006`
   - Example: `https://192.168.1.100:8006`
3. Accept the self-signed certificate warning (this is normal)
4. Login with:
   - **Username**: `root`
   - **Realm**: `Linux PAM standard authentication`
   - **Password**: The password you set during installation

> **Pro Tip**: Bookmark this URL! You'll access it frequently.

## Post-Installation: Essential Tasks

> **⚡ Quick Option**: Want to automate these steps? Check out the [Post-Install Script](/infrastructure/proxmox-post-install) that handles repository configuration, updates, and subscription nag removal automatically with a single command!

You can configure these settings manually (shown below) or use the automated script above.

### 1. Update Proxmox

After logging in, you'll see a subscription warning. Don't worry - Proxmox is free to use!

Open the node shell (click your node name → Shell) and run:

```bash
apt update
```

```bash
apt dist-upgrade -y
```

### 2. Configure Update Repositories (No Subscription)

If you're not using a Proxmox subscription (most homelabbers don't), configure the free repository:

```bash
echo "# deb https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pve-enterprise" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
```

```bash
echo "deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pve-no-subscription" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-no-subscription.list
```

```bash
apt update
```

> **Pro Tip**: The "no subscription" repository is perfectly fine for homelab use. The enterprise repository requires a paid subscription.

### 3. Disable Subscription Nag (Optional)

To remove the subscription popup:

```bash
sed -Ezi.bak "s/(Ext.Msg.show\(\{\s+title: gettext\('No valid sub)/void\(\{ \/\/\1/g" /usr/share/javascript/proxmox-widget-toolkit/proxmoxlib.js
```

```bash
systemctl restart pveproxy.service
```

## Next Steps

Now that Proxmox is installed, you can:

- **Create your first VM**: Upload an ISO and create a virtual machine
- **Set up LXC containers**: Lightweight containers for services
- **Configure storage**: Add additional drives or network storage
- **Set up backups**: Configure automated backup schedules
- **Explore clustering**: Connect multiple Proxmox hosts (advanced)

## Pro Tips & Best Practices

### Hardware Considerations
- **Use SSDs** for VM storage - the performance difference is massive
- **ECC RAM** is recommended for production but not required for homelabs
- **Dedicated NICs** for storage networks improve performance
- **Consider a UPS** to prevent data corruption during power loss

### Network Setup
- Reserve the Proxmox IP in your router's DHCP settings
- Consider setting up a separate VLAN for management traffic
- Use multiple NICs for redundancy and performance (bonding)

### Storage Planning
- Keep the OS on a separate disk from VM storage if possible
- Use local storage for VMs that need high performance
- Network storage (NFS, Ceph) works great for backups and less critical VMs
- Set up regular backups from day one

### Security
- Change the root password periodically
- Set up two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Use firewall rules to restrict access to port 8006
- Keep Proxmox updated regularly

## Official Documentation

This guide covers the basics to get you started quickly. For advanced topics, consult the official documentation:

- **[Proxmox VE Installation Guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/chapter-pve-installation.html)** - Comprehensive installation documentation
- **[Proxmox VE Administration Guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html)** - Complete system administration reference
- **[Proxmox VE Wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page)** - Community-maintained documentation and tutorials

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Web Interface
- Verify the IP address with `ip addr show` in the server console
- Check firewall rules: `iptables -L`
- Ensure port 8006 isn't blocked by your network firewall

### Virtualization Not Working
- Verify virtualization is enabled in BIOS: `egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo` (should return > 0)
- Reboot and enable VT-x/AMD-V in BIOS settings

### Installation Fails
- Verify ISO checksum - corrupt download is a common issue
- Try different USB creation tools (Rufus DD mode vs Etcher)
- Check hardware compatibility on the Proxmox forums
