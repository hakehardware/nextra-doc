# Infrastructure

Essential guides for setting up and configuring the foundation of your self-hosted environment.

## Overview

Before deploying specific applications, you'll need a solid infrastructure foundation. This section covers the core platforms and technologies that everything else runs on top of.

## What's Covered

### Proxmox VE
Learn how to set up and configure Proxmox Virtual Environment, the open-source virtualization platform that lets you run both containers (LXC) and virtual machines (VMs) on a single host.

### Ubuntu Server
Step-by-step guides for installing and configuring Ubuntu Server, whether you're running it on bare metal, as a Proxmox VM, or as your base operating system.

### Docker & Docker Compose
Master containerization with Docker. Learn how to deploy applications in isolated containers, manage multi-container applications with Docker Compose, and implement best practices for security and maintenance.

### Networking
Understanding networking fundamentals is crucial for self-hosting. Learn about port forwarding, reverse proxies, VLANs, and how to properly network your services together.

## Why Start Here?

These infrastructure guides provide the foundational knowledge you'll need for the AI tools, automation platforms, and media servers covered in other sections. Whether you're setting up ComfyUI in a Proxmox LXC, running n8n in Docker, or deploying Jellyfin on bare metal, you'll reference these guides.
