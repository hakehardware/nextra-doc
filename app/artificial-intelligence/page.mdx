# Artificial Intelligence

Comprehensive guides for deploying and managing AI infrastructure, from image generation to large language models.

## Overview

This section covers everything you need to run AI workloads on your self-hosted infrastructure. Whether you're setting up image generation with ComfyUI, running local LLMs with Ollama, or creating user-friendly interfaces with Open WebUI, these guides will walk you through multiple deployment options.

## Featured Tools

### ComfyUI
A powerful and modular interface for Stable Diffusion and other image generation models. ComfyUI offers a node-based workflow system that gives you complete control over your image generation pipeline.

**Deployment Options:**
- Proxmox LXC containers
- Docker containers
- Bare metal installation (like on Bob, your AI machine)

### Ollama
Run large language models locally with ease. Ollama provides a simple interface for downloading, managing, and running models like Llama 3, Mistral, and more.

**Deployment Options:**
- Proxmox VMs with GPU passthrough
- Docker containers with NVIDIA runtime

### Open WebUI
A feature-rich web interface for interacting with LLMs. Similar to ChatGPT's interface but for your self-hosted models. Connect it to Ollama or other OpenAI-compatible APIs.

**Deployment Options:**
- Docker containers
- Integration guides for connecting to Ollama and other AI services

## Hardware Considerations

Running AI workloads efficiently requires proper hardware:
- **GPU requirements** for image generation and LLM inference
- **RAM considerations** for different model sizes
- **Storage planning** for models and generated content

Many guides in this section reference "Bob" - a dedicated bare metal AI machine optimized for these workloads.

## Integration with Other Services

AI tools become even more powerful when integrated with automation platforms like n8n or Home Assistant. Check the **Automation** section for guides on connecting these services together.
